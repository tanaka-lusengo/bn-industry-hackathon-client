BrainStation industry 24h hackathon with UX design team

Our challenge: How might we develop a digital solution (or use technology) to support eco-friendly systems and have a greater societal impact in clean energy?

We developed a web app for Site Managers and Quantity Surveyors in the construction industry to sell off excess materials that would otherwise have gone to waste. This is the front-end for the project, which runs with a back-end database that is filled with seed "dummy" data for various construction companies selling their waste. The API allows GET of all listings, GET of all listings of a single company, POST to the listings and DELETE of a listing.

The corresponding back-end can be found here: https://github.com/Dunya-8a/bn-industry-hackathon-server
